          What is CityView?
        </h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Cityview is a system for communicating urban data through clear and informative
          visualizations. We have split up these visualization into 3 categories, livability,
          events and demographics.

              <h4>Livability</h4>
              <p>
                Our livability category attempts to showcase areas in
                Boston we feel might be more livable based on our own
                metric which takes into account trees, wifi coverage
                and other aspects. In this visualization, you can easily
                select different elements we believe correspond to
                better livability in Boston and see their corresponding
                locations within the city.

              <h4>Events</h4>
              <p>
                Our events category contains the most recent data regarding
                crimes, traffic incidents, and more. This category pulls
                new data as soon as it arrives directly from the public datasets
                the city keeps updated so you will always get the most recent
                data. You can select different categories and see on the a
                where the events occured with whatever information was reported
                alongside them, such as "crime: homicide"

              <h4>Demographics</h4>
              <p>
                Our Demographics section focuses on giving a very easy to use and
                interactive experience with exploring the demographics of boston
                in the past up to the present. You can select the year and
                neighborhood using the sunburst. Once you have made your selection
                you will see the ratios of races in that time period and neighborhood.
                You will also see a bar chart pop up next to the sunburst which will
                give you a different way to see the data to make it easier for you
                to understand.
